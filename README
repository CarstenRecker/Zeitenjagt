# Zeitenjagt

Zeitenjagt is a web application that allows car enthusiasts to log and share their 100-200 km/h acceleration times, compare performance metrics, and view detailed specifications. This app aims to replace a Facebook group where users currently share their acceleration data by providing a streamlined, dedicated platform for tracking and comparing car performance.
